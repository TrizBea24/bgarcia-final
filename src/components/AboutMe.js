        Recently I have finished my studies as a developer<br />  at Bottega University and General Assembly. 
        I invite you to check in this<br />  portfolio my projects<br />  and all the technologies<br />  I have applied<br />  to them.<br />  
        Along my working experience<br />  I had the chance to develop<br />  in two main fields<br /> : Communication & Marketing <br /> 
        and Social Services.<br />  My first approach to technology <br /> started when<br />  I built my first websites with 
        WordPress. <br /> Then I designed and built an online shop with WooCommerce which <br /> I have been managing 
        for more than 5 years. My values drove me to work as a diversity consultant and cooperation officer.<br />
        Now it is time to merge social impact with technology and continue developing my IT skill</p>
